- Ensure that you always read Implementation.md file at the beginning of each session and each step.

- Ensure you reflect the implemented phases / features in the file Implementation.md for future reference. Do not create new documentation files, such as: "NEW_FEATURE_UPDATE_REPORT.md". Instead, reflect this in Implementation.md or OpenBB_Migration_Guide.md file. 

- Always drop comments in code for future guidance and identification. Always update the necessary documentation or comments when making an update to code.
