- Ensure that you always read docs/Implementation.md file at the beginning of each session and each step.

- Ensure you reflect the implemented phases / features in the file docs/Implementation.md for future reference. Do not create new documentation files, such as: "NEW_FEATURE_UPDATE_REPORT.md". Instead, the changes in:
-- implementation.md
-- Readme.md
-- or other relevant documentation specific for that task (for example, FPS_GPS_Implementation.md for that feature's development, etc.)

- Always drop comments in code for future guidance and identification. Always update the necessary documentation or comments when making an update to code. 

- If a file is larger than 1000+ lines, then you must sample the files in 1-500, 501-1000 line segments for your tool calls to not fail / timeout.
